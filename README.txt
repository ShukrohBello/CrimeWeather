HOW TO RUN
________________

Make sure the two .csv files, weather_2015, and weather_2016 are in the same
directory as your jupyter notebook.

Next, download the crime_reports.csv file from the drive link below, making
sure to save the file to the same directory as the notebook.

https://drive.google.com/a/andrew.cmu.edu/file/d/0B_qpoAT8HOczYThEeFQ0M2dNN0U/view?usp=sharing

From there you should be able to easily run the code by simply running each
cell from beginning to end, making sure to pip install and import the 
necessary libraries in the first cell of the notebook.
